It will help you visualize your address book in Google Maps.

Well, maybe. Right now there are several manual steps you'd have to take like generating a JSON file of your CSV. (until the CSV converter is installed).

Eventually the tool might even help you export your plot points onto a map inside your
own Google Map collections.

ToDo:
  * localize external javascript libraries
  * turn sidebar into a slideout, possibly to work as a gmap overlay (yahoomaps/mapquest/etc)
  * add a csv converter!!
  * add something like gist/dropbox/whatever as an output option
  * add some iceland travel tips :)
